  Information about Gaza:
</h1>
<h3>
  Gaza was known as the biggest open air prison in the world. Gaza had a choking siege through land, air, and sea. Gaza is known to be the most densely populated place on earth. Under all these hardships Gaza has faced, they still were able to establish  four universities and boasted to have the largest PHD holders per square mile in the world. Most of their population are refugees from other parts of Palestine that were evacuated and displaced by Israel and had settled by force in Gaza. Fuel and electricity are scarce and all its ports are closed. Throughout the years, the people in Gaza have been trying to break the embargo force upon them by Israel. Whatever happened on October 7th, 2023 was an outcome to this unfair treatment and was a matter of time until people rebelled.
