<h3>
This is a Lybian family. The Dad is fully Libyan, he has his PHD in engineering from an american university, his daughter Sarah, is an American citizen. The family lived in America the first 10 years of their life but then the parents visa ended. 
They had to move back to Libya, they tired to get in contact with the American embassy to try and get visas so they can move back to America, the embassy told them to come to Jordan, and the Jordanian embassy will take care of him and his family.
When they arrived at the embassy here, they said that nothing could be done. They came into the country illegally and are not permanent residents or citizens so he can not get a job. His daughter is an American citizen and therefore can not get into any public school. 
Him and his family are now stuck here and do not have a way out. They are trying to work and learn from classes in CRP, yet they are desperate for a more long term sollution.
