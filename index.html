      <h2>What is the refugee crisis:</h2>
      <p>A refugee crisis occurs when a large number of displaced individuals are forced to leave their home country and seek refuge somewhere else, often under difficult or perilous circumstances. The crisis can be viewed from the perspective of the refugees themselves, the host country, or both. During their leave, refugees often lack basic necessities such as food and clean water, and many possess nothing beyond the clothes they wear. <br>The status of a refugee can be thrust upon a person in a moment of crisis. Conflict and war stands as primarily the main cause of the widespread displacement of populations compelling individuals to seek refuge. Often, individuals can find themselves into the status of refugee practically overnight when violence happens due to war or political upheaval within a nation. <br> As of 2024, Jordan, with a population of an estimated 11 million, maintains the second highest per capita refugee intake globally. With over 1.3 million refugees hosted, and 760,000 registered with the UNHCR, and predominantly half of the refugees hosted are Syrian nationals. Jordan also shelters approximately 77,335 individuals from other nations. </p>
      <br>
      <h2>What is UNHCR:</h2>
      <p>The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) endeavors to safeground lives and fosters promising futures for the countless individuals compelled to abandon their residence. Since 1950, UNHCR has confronted numerous crises across various continents, extending crucial protection and aid to refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced individuals, often serving as their sole refuge. UNHCR’s mission is to ensure that all refugees, fleeing violence, persecutions, or conflict in their homelands, can seek asylum and find secure sanctuary shelter. </p>

      <h1>UNRWA Mission</h1></div>
      <h2>The United Nation Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) is a non-governmental organization (NGO) established by the United Nations General Assembly on December 8, 1949, and commenced operations on May 1, 1950. As one of the largest United Nations programs, UNRWA has been significant for over six decades in delivering essential services aimed at welfare, education, human development, and protection of Palestine refugees. </p><p> Its mission is to ease the hardships faced by these refugees until a resolution to the Palestinian refugee question is achieved. The operational definition of Palestine refugees borders individuals whose habitual residence was Palestine between June 1946 and May 1948, and who lost both their homes and sources of livelihood due to the 1948 Arab-Israeli conflict. Additionally, descendants of male Palestine refugees are allowed for registration as Palestine refugees. </p><p> The mission of UNRWA is to support Palestine refugees in reaching their full potential in human development despite the challenging circumstances they face. This mission aligns with internationally agreed goals and standards. To achieve this, the Agency delivers a range of services to Palestine refugees in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Lebanon, and Syria, all within the framework of international standards. UNRWA stands out among United Nations (UN) agencies for its special approach of delivering services directly to donors. Overall, UNRWA provides protection, infrastructure, and camp improvement services. </h2>
